# Task-1
Task-1 — Foundations of Cybersecurity &amp; Lab Environment Setup
Author: Parvatham Sri Vardhan
Internship: ApexPlanet — Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking Internship
Task: Task-1 (Days 1–12) — Build fundamentals, set up lab, tool familiarization, capture & document evidence.

Executive Summary

This task establishes a controlled cybersecurity lab for hands-on learning. The lab uses VirtualBox with Kali Linux as the attacker machine and Metasploitable2 / DVWA as vulnerable targets. Hands-on topics include Linux basics, networking (OSI/TCP-IP), cryptography (OpenSSL), packet capture (Wireshark), scanning (Nmap), web proxying (Burp Suite), and network debugging (Netcat). All work is performed only on lab VMs under my control.

Objectives

Build strong fundamentals: CIA triad, common threats, attack vectors.

Configure a private, isolated hacking lab (VirtualBox Host-Only).

Install and verify Kali Linux, Metasploitable2 (and optionally DVWA).

Familiarize with tools: Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Netcat.

Demonstrate packet capture and scanning; document findings and mitigations.

Produce deliverables: screenshots, cheatsheet.md, scan outputs, 5-min demo video.

Safe & Ethical Notice

All scans, captures, and exploitation were performed only on lab machines I own/control (Kali & Metasploitable2). Do not run these techniques on networks or systems without explicit permission.
